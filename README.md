# VisualG
Basic algorithims written in portugol, a programming language for beginners

In some brazillian colleges they use portugol to program basic things so students get to learn programming logic,
for this, we use a program called VisualG

I'm not sure if i'll keep posting all algorithms i develop with VisualG,
i was just testing how github works and getting used to it
